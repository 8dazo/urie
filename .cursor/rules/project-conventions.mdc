# Urie — Project context

- **Product:** AI agency + creator platform. Agencies manage creators; creators have multiple social accounts (e.g. several Instagram/TikTok accounts). Workflow: Kanban (campaigns, content tasks, approval), scheduling, posting, AI insights.
- **Plan:** Read [plan/ai-agency-creator-platform.md](plan/ai-agency-creator-platform.md) for goals, user types, workflow, MongoDB model, AI integration, and MVP scope.
- **Guidelines:** Read [docs/GUIDELINES.md](docs/GUIDELINES.md) for stack, conventions, key locations, and priorities.

## Conventions

- Prefer additive, backward-compatible changes; use constants for DB/API field names.
- New features should align with plan (workflow first, IG + TikTok first, MongoDB, migrations in `backend/migrations/` when present).
- When changing schema or adding collections, follow plan §8 (schema evolution): migrations idempotent, optional `schemaVersion`, staging first.
